<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Implement computer vision: You could add a camera or depth sensor to your robot arm and use computer vision techniques to detect and track objects in the environment. This would allow your robot arm to perform more complex tasks, such as picking and placing objects in specific locations.
Add more degrees of freedom: A 4DOF robot arm is a good starting point, but you could add more degrees of freedom to make the arm more versatile and flexible. This would allow the arm to reach and manipulate objects from different angles and orientations.
Create a user interface: You could develop a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI) to control your robot arm. This would make it easier for users to interact with the arm and perform tasks without needing to understand the underlying code or algorithms.
Use machine learning: You could use machine learning techniques to train your robot arm to perform specific tasks, such as object recognition or path planning. This would enable your arm to learn and adapt to new situations, making it more useful in a variety of contexts.
README:

The 4DOF robot arm is a project designed to create a robotic arm capable of moving in four different directions. Using the ROS Melodic framework and the MoveIt1 path planning library, this arm is capable of executing complex motion paths and avoiding obstacles and collisions. Further development of the project could include implementing computer vision, adding more degrees of freedom, creating a user interface, or using machine learning techniques.
